    <p class="ptrav1">I dreamed of visiting Austria, especially Vienna, this city attracted me with its architecture, art, theaters, museums and the famous chocolate with the image of Mozart. I was surprised by the expensive prices for food and transport but my dream was worth it because I visited Stefan's Cathedral which has an unusual architectural design. My friend and I went on a tour of Vienna, it was exciting and we went around all the sights. I had many positive emotions and inspiration from this trip.<br><br></p>

<p class="ptrav2">I went to Poland to my best friend whom I have known since the 8th grade. I have not seen her for a long time and came to Warsaw to meet her and look at this city. I noticed different people from different countries who wanted to get to know us. Warsaw was cheaper in all country plans than Lithuania. Dasha was my guide in Warsaw and we visited different places like Lazienki Palace and walked in the parks every day because the weather was warm. This trip was emotional for me because I met my best friend whom I had not seen for a long time.<br><br></p>

<p class="ptrav3">Turkey became my home because my parents moved to Istanbul. My parents always show me new places and restaurants in Istanbul. My favorite place is Taksim it's a crowded place where musicians gather and sing and dance in the streets. There are also many different shops for shopping and restaurants of different cuisines. Istanbul leaves me good emotions because I spend time with my family and I know that I will be back again soon.
