    <p id="pabout">My name is Karina Bagirova, I am from Shymkent, Kazakhstan. I have a small family that now lives in Turkey in Istanbul. In Shymkent, I went to different circles, swimming, tennis, dancing and ballet. I was always on the move and I liked to dance, create and organize something of my own, I can call myself a creative person.<br><br>
I studied at a private school with good grades and dreamed of going to some university in Europe and traveling to different countries. When I thought about it, my uncle Ayat Azimov graduated from the LCC International University in business administration in 2013, now he is a well-known businessman in Kazakhstan and in my city. I decided to enter the LCC University after my uncle only at the Contemporary Communication Faculty because I always liked to come up with different events and communicate with different people. This opportunity is provided to me by LCC International University. I like to learn something new to communicate with different people and thereby develop my worldview.
